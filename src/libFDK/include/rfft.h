 * \brief Perform an inplace real FFT using a complex fft of half length.
 *
 * A FFT of an real input signal with N input samples results (N/2+1) complex output samples.
 * To get the (N/2+1) complex output values the input buffer has to be at least N+2 samples. If the
 * input buffer has only N samples the real part of (N/2+1) complex value is written into imaginary
 * part of first complex output value.

 * first and (N/2+1) spectral value must be zero. Alternatively it's possible to feed the IFFT with
